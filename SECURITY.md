## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you've discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Do NOT create a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Publicly disclosing these vulnerabilities could put the wider community at risk.** 

We request that all security reporting be done through sensitive email communications. If you've found a vulnerability, please contact us at [r4mbhardwaj@gmail.com]

In your report, please include:

- The steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Include any code you had to write or run, settings you had to tweak, or any other setup work you had done.
- The impact on users or the system if this vulnerability is exploited, to the best of your knowledge or understanding.
- Any potential fixes or mitigations, if you have any in mind.

Our Security Team will then get back to you as soon as possible, generally within 24 hours, with our next steps.

Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure. Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered.

Thank you for helping make our project safer! We appreciate your patience and discretion in this manner.
